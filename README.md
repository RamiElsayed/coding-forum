## Descirption
- this application is designed for beginner web developers to start threads or add comments.
- In the future I will add more features as user can get more resources through choosing a certain category from a dropdown list.


- it was a good opportunity to learn how to build routes and add features though itteration.
- My object was to get the different pages built and connected then I could itterate and add more features.
- Heroku as the deployment service that allows developers to deploy projects in the cloud.

### Technologies

- Handlebars to build the frontend pages and connect different pages together.
- Sequelize to build models and query data.
- Express.js to build the app and middlewares to get data from and to the database.
- Mysql as the relational database manament system.

#### Future plans
Adding resources for each thread category through third parties APIs
